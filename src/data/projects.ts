    description:
      "A blockchain-based DApp designed for transparent agricultural product traceability. The application provides a full-featured user system including registration, login, authentication, password management, profile settings, and account management.

A backend service listens to blockchain events, synchronizes data, and generates QR codes for each product. End users can scan QR codes via the mobile app to view detailed production histories in real time. Additional features include news publishing and management, farm bookmarking, product tracking, and administrative tools, delivering functionality comparable to a production-ready commercial application.",
